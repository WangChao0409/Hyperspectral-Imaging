# Hyperspectral-Imaging
# This matlab code is about the iptimized filter design for hyperspectral cameras using NMF and genetic algorithm for efficient spectral reconstruction.
# The main file is HImage.m. Please run this m file to see the results.

# This code is about the design of the filter for HSI cameras with 9 channels and 16 channels.

# If you want to see the results for 16 channels, please let m=16 at the beginning of the HImage.m file.
